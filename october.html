                I love game night! Or at least, I usually do. Seemingly, someone at my last game night stole my favorite game, <u>Sequence</u>. That board game is my <u>greatest</u>, most prized possession, so I've gathered everyone who was there that night to question them. Here are their responses.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Paul</u>: I am far too polite to steal one of your games. Besides, I was playing Mouse Trap all night.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Patrick</u>: I would never even play Sequence! I was playing Candy Land, the prime example of a well-designed board game.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Linda</u>: I was never by the Sequence table. That game is just about getting lucky, anyways. I was playing Catan.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Pete</u>: You call Sequence "perfect?" A real example of a perfect game is Mastermind. That's what I was playing.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Fred</u>: I'm sorry to hear that! Fortunately, no one stole Trivial Pursuit. I love that game.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Harry</u>: I'm happy to say that I had no involvement. Me and some folks were just playing Clue that night.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Porter</u>: There's no practical reason I would ever steal one of your games. I'm happy just playing Kerplunk with some buddies.<br>
                <br>
                Can you tell me who stole Sequence?<br>
